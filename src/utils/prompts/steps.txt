I'm a test engineer writing tests in Playwright using Typescript.
I've opened a web page and I want to thoroughly follow the instructions: {{ action }}.

Use realistic test data (consider defined and typical validations) and locators from this HTML:
```html
{{ html }}
```

Generate a sequence of actions, represented in JSON format, ensuring each step aligns with the instructions given. 
Pay close attention to situations where action is unnecessary, such as attempting to perform an action that's 
already achieved or navigating to a page you're already on.
```json
[
    { "step": 1, "locator": "#query", "value": "iPhone", "action": "fill" },
    { "step": 2, "locator": "#search", "value": "", "action": "click" }
]
```
